    - Action: Implement better caching strategy
    - COMPLETED: Added specialized cached functions for efficient data access

PERFORMANCE BOTTLENECKS - MEDIUM PRIORITY
-----------------------------------------
[✓] 4. Optimize String Operations
    - Problem: Heavy HTML markup generation with concatenation
    - File: callbacks.py
    - Action: Use more efficient string formatting
    - COMPLETED: Replaced string concatenation with pl.format() for better performance

[✓] 5. Reduce Redundant Sorting Operations
    - Problem: DataFrame sorted multiple times in pipeline
    - File: player_combinations.py, callbacks.py
    - Action: Consolidate sorting operations
    - COMPLETED: Consolidated sorting operations in lazy evaluation chain

[✓] 6. Cache Common Operations
    - Problem: Duplicate calculations in multiple files
    - File: player_combinations.py, callbacks.py
    - Action: Pre-compute and cache frequently used operations
    - COMPLETED: Added caching for helper functions and optimized computations

CODE QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS - LOW PRIORITY
----------------------------------------
[✓] 7. Optimize DataFrame Operations
    - Problem: Unnecessary intermediate variables and copies
    - File: player_combinations.py, callbacks.py
    - Action: Chain operations more efficiently
    - COMPLETED: Chained operations to reduce intermediate DataFrame copies

[✓] 8. Improve UI Rendering Efficiency
    - Problem: Large datasets cause slow rendering
    - File: layout.py, callbacks.py
    - Action: Implement better pagination and virtual scrolling
    - COMPLETED: Added virtualization, filtering, increased page size, and improved styling

[✓] 9. Add Memory Usage Monitoring
    - Problem: No visibility into memory consumption
    - File: All files
    - Action: Add logging and monitoring for memory usage
    - COMPLETED: Added psutil-based memory monitoring and comprehensive logging

EXPECTED PERFORMANCE GAINS
--------------------------
- Memory Usage: 30-50% reduction
- Processing Speed: 20-40% improvement  
- UI Responsiveness: 15-25% faster rendering
